      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>Welcome to RSM Pet Store's about page. The website that you are seeing is the product of Rafael Briones, Michael Cheung, and Sydney Orr, who are currently going into week 5 of Dev Point Labs Full Stack Web Development Course. The project was done for a hackathon that was hosted on Septemeber 11th  which is a event that goes from 9:30 MST to 17:30 MST, that has an hour lunch and grading for the last hour. </p>
      <h3>About The Website</h3>
      <p>The website that you are seeing imitation of the Utah based website, KSL, with the exception that it is only a Pet store with pet related items on sale, and a job page. Each model was worked on by a team member and the styling is done mostly (basically all) by Rafael.</p>
